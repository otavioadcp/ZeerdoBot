# ZeerdoBot

This is a experimental bot for discord, made with Node.js only for study.

There are a few commands available right now:

- @play [URL]: Will play de song at the link provided, or add to the queue
- @skip: Will skip the actual song
- @stop: Will stop the song and remove the bot from the channel
